/*
During the mounting phase, a functional component is being 
created and added to the DOM. In this phase, you typically 
initialise state and perform any setup thatâ€™s needed when 
the component is first rendered.

The useState hook allows you to add state to your 
functional components. It replaces the need for a 
constructor and this.state in class components. You can 
initialise state and retrieve the current value
